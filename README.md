# The Ptera Keyboard
This is a "fork" of the [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform), a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

I have ported the entire thing over from clojure into raw SCAD language, to make it way easier to use.

The main goals are to make it a bit smoother, easier to fit to your hand, and also as a learning project

## Assembly
For tips on actually building this thing, please refer back to [the original page](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform), as anything I say here would just be copied anyway
